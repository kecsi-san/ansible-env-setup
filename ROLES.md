# Roles

Status legend: ✅ Done | 🔧 Implemented (not wired) | 🚧 Incomplete | 📋 Planned

---

## Naming Standard

Role names follow the pattern: **`<verb>_<subject>`** or **`<verb>_<subject>-<qualifier>`**

### Verbs

| Verb | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `configure_` | Modifying config files, adjusting settings, or wiring shell initialisation |
| `setup_` | Installing packages/services or performing multi-step environment setup |
| `install_` | Installing a single tool or package manager via a package manager |
| `upload_` | Copying or deploying static files to remote hosts |
| `disable_` | Disabling or masking a system feature or service |
| `debian_` | OS-specific upgrade or migration tasks (Debian only) |
| `report_` | Notifications or announcements triggered at playbook completion |

### Subject

- Use **lowercase** only
- Use a **hyphen** (`-`) to separate multiple words within the subject: e.g. `setup_network-tools`, `setup_cloud-aws`
- Use an **underscore** (`_`) only as the separator between verb and subject

### Examples

```
configure_ssh          ✅ correct
setup_cloud-aws        ✅ correct
install_linuxbrew      ✅ correct
upload_fav_bgimages    ✅ correct
setupNetworkTools      ❌ wrong — no camelCase
setup_network_tools    ❌ wrong — underscores in subject
networktools_setup     ❌ wrong — subject before verb
```

## Directory and File Structure

Every role must have `tasks/main.yml` and `README.md`. Add the others as needed.

```
roles/<role-name>/
├── tasks/
│   └── main.yml           # Required — task definitions
├── defaults/
│   └── main.yml           # User-overridable variables (lowest precedence)
├── vars/
│   ├── main.yml           # Role-internal constants (not meant to be overridden)
│   └── os/
│       └── Debian.yml     # OS-specific variable overrides
├── files/                 # Static files deployed with ansible.builtin.copy
├── templates/             # Jinja2 templates deployed with ansible.builtin.template
├── handlers/
│   └── main.yml           # Handlers triggered by notify:
└── README.md              # Required — purpose, variables, usage, notes
```

Use `roles/role_template/` as a starting point when creating a new role.

## 🔧 Implemented — has tasks but not wired into any playbook yet

| Role | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `debian_dist_upgrade` | Debian major version in-place upgrade | Older/simpler version — likely superseded by `debian_dist_upgrade_12to13`; consider removing |
| `debian_dist_upgrade_12to13` | Full Debian 12→13 migration with disk space check and reboot | Needs its own playbook (e.g. `dist-upgrade.yml`) |
| `setup_etckeeper` | Git-backs `/etc` via etckeeper | `etckeeper: true` is set in group_vars but role is not in any playbook |
| `setup_kube-extra` | Copies kubeconfig from cluster node; sets `KUBECONFIG` | Needs wiring into `post-k8s.yml` |
